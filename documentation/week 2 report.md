* Made the layout for the board and a way for the bot to differentiate the different pieces and their colours(mostly if it's hostile or its own piece).
* Wrote most rules of the chess for the bot, it's still missing the rule for castling and the information when it's in check
* Bot somewhat works in lichess now but only for white side but that will fixed next week
* Little bit testing. Would have done way more if I had enough time but this will most likely be fixed next week.
* Had a little trouble with getting the bot understand which are its pieces in lichess but I think have it covered for next week without any hiccups.
* Jacoco and much more have already been added to the template and these can found after building the project with the command `./gradlew build`.
* Time spent: around 12h.

**Next week**

* Finish making the rules so that it's fully functionable in lichess.
* More testing.
* Start with a min-max algorithm so the bot won't make as dumb moves.
