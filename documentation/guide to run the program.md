Getting the bot work is quite simple. First download code and extract it to your desired location. After that Register to [Lichess](https://lichess.org/signup).
Then you'll have create your own [personal API access token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token/create) and choose all the scopes. If you have ever played as a human, you'll have to delete your token, close your account to register it as a bot and then finally create a new token. After that, upgrade your account to a bot: `curl -d '' https://lichess.org/api/bot/account/upgrade -H "Authorization: Bearer INSERT YOUR TOKEN HERE"`
Now you should be able to try the bot. To do that, go to [lichess](https://lichess.org/), select "**play with computer**", then go to git bash or whatever terminal you're using and navigate to destination where you extracted the file. Type `./gradlew build`, and finally type `./gradlew run --args="--lichess --token=put_token_here"`.
To close the program use CTRL+C.
