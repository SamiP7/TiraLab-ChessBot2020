* Decided what the project was about
* Copied the template to master
* Studied the given template and trying to understand it in depth
* Written some documentation
* Time spent: around 3-4h

**Next week**

* Start working on the bot by first making the possible rules for each piece
* Possibly make a very early version of the bot which could at least move the pieces by itself every turn
